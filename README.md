#Statement of Purpose and Scope

This program is a task manager for chores that need to be done in shared households. Any member of the household with access to the program can create as well as edit and delete from the list of chore types available, while also being able to record what chores have done by whom, each with a unique time stamp that is saved to a history feature.

Since I live in a shared household and have a vastly different schedule from my two roommates, sharing mutual responsibilities such as feeding pets, washing dishes, vacuuming or taking the trash out can have difficulties owing to lapses in communication. 
For example, I may have fed the dogs within the hour, but if I suddenly leave or otherwise busy my lapse in communication ends with my room mate feeding them again. Some issues can be minute whilst others if left unfettered can create longer lasting problems, such as pet weight gain or excessive dirtiness. I figured if there was a way everyone could keep up to date with what's been done and what hasn't, these issues could be avoided.

The target audience is not specific in the sense that I am targeting anyone from a specific cultural, economic or sociological background. It's specifically targeted to those who live in shared accommodation. This could theoretically entail families, share houses, dorms, couples, or basically any location that has 2 or more individuals living in it. Because of the relative intended simplicity of the functions and interface, the app would be able to be used to by people from a wide variety of age groups, meaning both adults and children alike will be able to communicate what chores they have and haven't done effectively.

Once opening the program up on terminal, the end user would need to type of 6 commands, namely being; Do, Read, Create, Edit, Delete, Exit. The user can type in any one of those words featured in (uppercase, lowercase or a mixture thereof is fine) the menu and go to the next prompt, any invalid inputs will result in an error message, taking them back to the option menu. In the 'Do' section, the user can state what chore they have completed from a printed list sourced from the chore list folder. In the 'Read' section, there are 2 options, 1 is to read the list of chore types, the other is a history of chores done. In the 'Create' section, the user can create a new chore type, with that type being saved to be able to use in future instances of the 'Do' function. In the 'Edit' section, users can change the information of items saved in the chore list file. In the 'Delete' section, users can delete items from the chore list file. In the 'Exit' sections, users can exit the program.

Any users who use the program thereafter will be able to see any content that is been saved into the list from the 'Create' and 'Edit' options in the chore list section of the 'Read' area, whils also being able to browse a chore list history in the same section if the previous user had ran any instances of the 'Do' function.
