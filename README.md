#Statement of Purpose and Scope

This program is a task manager for chores that need to be done in shared households. Any member of the household with access to the program can create as well as edit and delete from the list of chore types available, while also being able to record what chores have done by whom, each with a unique time stamp that is saved to a history feature.

Since I live in a shared household and have a vastly different schedule from my two roommates, sharing mutual responsiblities such as feeding pets, washing dishes, vacuuming or taking the trash out can have difficulties owing to lapses in communication. 
For example, I may have fed the dogs within the hour, but if I suddenly leave or otherwise busy my lapse in communication ends with my room mate feeding them again. Some issues can be minute whilst others if left unfettered can create longer lasting problems, such as pet weight gain or excessive dirtiness. I figured if there was a way everyone could keep up to date with what's been done and what hasn't, these issues could be avoided.
